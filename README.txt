Java program that uses for and while loops.  The program asks the user if the summer is hot or mild.  If summer is 
hot, use a for loop to print out ten times that "it is a bad summer because the weather is too hot".
If summer is mild, use a for loop to print out ten times that "It is a great summer because the weather is mild".
Use a while loop to count how many days were over 80 degrees.
